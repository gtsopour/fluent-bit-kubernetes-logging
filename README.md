Kubernetes Logging with Fluent Bit

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io) is an open source Log Processor and Forwarder which allows you to collect any data like metrics and logs from different sources, enrich them with filters and send them to multiple destinations. It's the preferred choice for containerized environments like Kubernetes as it enriches the logs with Kubernetes metadata. Fluent Bit is designed with performance in mind: high throughput with low CPU and Memory usage. Fluent Bit is a CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) subproject under the umbrella of Fluentd.
